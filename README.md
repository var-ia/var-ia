**The open claim-history layer for public knowledge.**

> Refract reveals how claims change across public revision histories — where every
> claim came from, what supported it, what challenged it, when it stabilized, and
> what context altered its meaning.

Refract is the open claim-history layer for public knowledge — it ingests revision histories from
Wikipedia, Fandom, and any MediaWiki instance, extracts a deterministic event stream
of every claim, source, section, and dispute, and makes that stream queryable and
reproducible. No model. No interpretation. Byte-for-byte identical on every run.

Built and maintained by [NextConsensus](https://nextconsensus.com). Refract is
domain-neutral infrastructure for observing how public knowledge changes.
[Repository boundary](./docs/repository-boundary.md).

![Concept Overview](./docs/diagrams/concept-overview.svg)

## Why It Exists

Machines do not just need more retrieved text. They need provenance, instability,
disagreement, and temporal change — six things that a current snapshot cannot provide:

1. **Where it appeared** — when a claim first entered the public record
2. **How it changed** — every addition, removal, reintroduction, and in-place modification
3. **What was tagged** — policy templates, dispute signals, maintenance markers
4. **What was reverted** — every revert, edit cluster, concentrated contestation
5. **What moved** — section reorganization, lead promotion, category shifts, page moves
6. **What was discussed** — correlated talk page activity, thread lifecycle, activity spikes

Refract makes that knowledge legible to machines by decomposing every statement
into its history. That is more durable than search, monitoring, or summarization.

## What It Does

Given a MediaWiki page, the engine produces a structured event stream with 26
deterministic event types:

| Category | What Refract captures |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Appearance** | `sentence_first_seen`, `sentence_removed`, `sentence_modified`, `sentence_reintroduced` |
| **Citations** | `citation_added`, `citation_removed`, `citation_replaced` |
| **Templates** | `template_added`, `template_removed`, `template_parameter_changed` |
| **Sections** | `section_reorganized`, `lead_promotion`, `lead_demotion` |
| **Reverts** | `revert_detected`, `edit_cluster_detected` |
| **Links & categories** | `wikilink_added`, `wikilink_removed`, `category_added`, `category_removed` |
| **Page metadata** | `page_moved`, `protection_changed` |
| **Talk page** | `talk_page_correlated`, `talk_thread_opened`, `talk_thread_archived`, `talk_reply_added`, `talk_activity_spike` |

## Who This Is For

- **Investigative journalists** — trace how a claim about a public figure evolved
  across revision history: when it was added, who softened it, when sources
  appeared or disappeared
- **Wikipedia editors** — audit how policy templates (NPOV, BLP, due-weight)
  correlate with content changes over time
- **Data scientists & researchers** — deterministic features for edit-quality
  models, sourcing-behavior studies, content-drift measurement
- **OSINT analysts** — structured event streams from public editorial history,
  reproducible on request
- **Fan wiki communities** — canon disputes, headcanon drift, content-fork
  detection across MediaWiki instances
- **AI/ML teams** — training data curation (include stable, well-sourced claims; exclude contested or source-fragile ones), provenance-aware RAG, temporal leakage detection in training corpora
- **Regulatory & compliance monitors** — track changes to drug safety pages, guideline entries, and policy language for early signals of institutional shifts
- **Knowledge graph engineers** — extract entity and relationship changes across revision history for evolving ontologies
- **Publishers & platform trust teams** — monitor how claims spread, get cited, and stabilize across the public record

## What Downstream Systems Build

Each consumer brings their own interpretation layer on top of Refract's deterministic event stream:

| Consumer | They build | How they use Refract |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Healthcare intelligence** | Sourced briefs answering "does this claim still hold up?" | Feed structured events into a 4-lane measurement pipeline (clinical truth, ratification, economic stake, feasibility). Each event carries `FactProvenance` with the exact thresholds used. |
| **AI training data curation** | Training datasets filtered by claim stability | Score each claim by revert count, citation churn, talk page correlation, and template dispute history from the event stream. Include only claims above a stability threshold. |
| **Provenance-aware RAG** | Retrieval that weights results by claim stability | Enrich each retrieved chunk with its claim history — stable, recently changed, source-fragile, contested. The RAG system uses the signal to filter or demote low-confidence results. |
| **Regulatory monitoring** | Early-warning dashboards for policy changes | Run `refract cron` on drug pages, guideline entries, and regulatory topics. When new events fire (citation removal, template dispute, section reorganization), alert the monitoring team with the structured diff. |
| **Competitive intelligence** | Cross-jurisdiction claim divergence maps | Use `refract diff` to compare the same topic across wikis (English vs German Wikipedia, Fandom vs independent wiki). Track how framing differs and when it diverged. |
| **Fact-checking** | Claim provenance timelines | Given a claim text, query its lifecycle across the event stream — first appearance, source additions, revert history, talk page correlation, stabilization time. Return a verifiable timeline. |
| **Academic research** | Large-scale knowledge dynamics studies | Export `ObservationReport` with Merkle-verifiable claim histories. Run cohort analyses on claim stability across topics, time periods, and editorial environments. |
| **Journalism forensics** | Edit pattern analysis for public figures | Track how a specific claim about a person or topic evolved. Look for coordinated editing, source softening, or removal without replacement. |
| **Fan wiki canon tracking** | Canon divergence detection across competing wikis | Compare the same fictional universe's page across Fandom and independent wikis. Detect when one wiki retcons content while the other doesn't — and by how much. |
| **Knowledge graph engineering** | Evolving ontologies from category and link changes | Use `refract analyze --depth forensic` to capture category_added/removed and wikilink_added/removed events. Build an entity graph that evolves with the public record. |

The common architecture: **Refract extracts the mechanical facts. The downstream system interprets what those facts mean for its domain.** No interpretation enters Refract's pipeline; no consumer re-extracts from raw revision history.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Analyze a page (zero install, no config needed)
npx @refract-org/cli analyze "Bitcoin" --depth brief

# 2. View results in the web UI
refract explore "Bitcoin"

# 3. Export as an ObservationReport with claim lifecycle
refract analyze "Bitcoin" --report > bitcoin-report.json

# 4. Save as a signed evidence bundle
refract export "Bitcoin" --bundle > bitcoin-bundle.json
```

> **What you're seeing**: These are observed changes — deterministic facts extracted from revision history. Refract reports what changed, not whether a claim is true or false.

What you'll see:

```
Analysis of "Bitcoin" at depth brief found 330 events across 20 revisions.

## How It Compares

Refract tracks **claim provenance** — structured evidence linking a claim's lifecycle
to specific revisions, sources, and policy signals. It complements existing tools:

| Tool | What it does | What Refract adds |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **WikiWho** | Sentence-level authorship (who wrote which token) | Sentence lifecycle: when a sentence first appeared, was removed, rewrote, or was reintroduced |
| **ORES** | ML edit quality scores (likely damaging, good-faith) | Deterministic edit classification + policy-coded signals |
| **XTools** | Edit stats, page history summaries, top editors | Structured event stream: section changes, citation turnover, template diffs, page moves, category shifts |
| **PetScan** | Category intersection queries across pages | Category evolution per-page over time |

## Architecture

The engine follows a two-knowledge-split:

1. **Deterministic**: Wikipedia API ingestion, diff computation, section
   extraction, citation tracking, template classification, revert detection —
   byte-reproducible, no model involved.
2. **Outcome labels**: Independently sourced ground truth (talk page
   consensus, page protection events) — never redefined by the pipeline.

[Full architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Configurable heuristics / BYO-inference boundaries

Every analyzer threshold is a typed function signature where a model can replace the default heuristic. The defaults work offline with no configuration required:

| Boundary | Default (mechanical) | Plug in a model to decide |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Sentence similarity | Word-overlap ratio (0.8) | "Are these two sentences the same claim?" |
| Revert detection | 6 regex patterns | "Is this edit comment a revert?" |
| Template classification | Name-to-type lookup | "What policy signal does this template represent?" |
| Edit cluster detection | Time window + min size | "Are these edits semantically related?" |
| Heuristic classification | Size thresholds + comment patterns | "What kind of edit is this?" |

Pass overrides via `--config` file or inline CLI flags (`--similarity`, `--spike-factor`, `--cluster-window`, etc.). The effective parameters are recorded in each event's `FactProvenance.parameters` when non-default values are used.

```bash
# Domain-tuned: Fandom wikis have tighter edit clusters
refract analyze "Darth_Vader" --api https://starwars.fandom.com/api.php --cluster-window 30 --similarity 0.85
```

## Private Instances

Refract connects to any MediaWiki instance — corporate wikis, institutional
knowledge bases, private fan wikis. Use the `--api` flag with the wiki's
`api.php` URL.

### Authentication

| Method | CLI flags | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Bearer token | `--api-key <token>` | Sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with every request |
| Basic auth | `--api-user <user> --api-password <pass>` | Sends HTTP basic auth credentials |
| OAuth2 | `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars | Sends `X-OAuth-Client-Id` and `X-OAuth-Client-Secret` headers |

All three methods work with every command:

```bash
# Bearer token
refract analyze "Page" --api https://corp-wiki.example.com/w/api.php --api-key "sk-..."

# Basic auth
refract analyze "Page" --api https://corp-wiki.example.com/w/api.php --api-user "admin" --api-password "..."

# OAuth2 (via env vars)
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="..." OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="..." \
  refract analyze "Page" --api https://corp-wiki.example.com/w/api.php
```

Credentials are never logged or exposed in error messages.

### Local Docker Testing

A Docker Compose setup is available for testing against a local MediaWiki
instance with auth:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
DOCKER_TESTS=true bun run test
```

This starts MediaWiki at `http://localhost:8080` and an nginx proxy with basic
auth at `http://localhost:8081`. The auth integration tests validate bearer
token, basic auth, and OAuth2 paths.

## Beyond Wikipedia

Refract works on any public MediaWiki instance — Fandom.com, independent fan wikis,
private wikis. Wikipedia's editorial norms suppress the most interesting dynamics;
fandom wikis don't.

| Dynamic | What Refract captures |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Canon disputes** | `category_removed`: `Canon characters` → `category_added`: `Legends characters` after the 2014 Disney acquisition |
| **Headcanon drift** | "Vader turned because of fear of loss" vs "pride and ambition" — reversibly edited, both cite the same films |
| **Warring wikis** | Cross-wiki diff detects a Game of Thrones Fandom wiki fork vs parallel evolution on an independent ASOIAF wiki |
| **Decade-spanning consensus** | 2008 talk page consensus about what's canon, overturned in 2023 — L3 outcome labels with temporal validity windows |

If the engine handles fandom, it handles anything.

## What It Is Not

| Category | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Truth detector | Reports what changed, not whether the change is accurate |
| Model interpreter | No LLM in the pipeline — interpretation lives downstream in consumers |
| Editor quality judge | No scoring, ranking, or profiling of individual editors |
| Prediction engine | No forecasting, no sentiment analysis, no trend extrapolation |
| Live monitor | Polling-based, not real-time — use `cron` mode for scheduled observation |
| Healthcare scorer | Domain-agnostic by design — no clinical, regulatory, or payer logic |
